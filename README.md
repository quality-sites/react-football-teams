# React Premiership Teams by Niyazi Niyazi

[Demo](http://www.quality-sites.com/sites/react-football-teams/)

The app shows a list of premiership teams and allows you to add more, edit existing and delete all of them.

## Future Improvements
 Will be adding unit testing to all components and added more integration tests also. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
